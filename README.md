### Description

The app **cms_pico** integrate [Pico](http://picocms.org/) in your Nextcloud. This will allow your users to create and manage their own websites with address like: https://cloud.example.com/sites/my_site/. The source of the website will be stored in the users' files and the **Markdown** will be formatted by **Pico** to generate the pages.

Because Pico is using the **Markdown** format, you should consider enabling the [Markdown Editor](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_markdown) app.


### Installation

After the git clone, install the composer dependencies:
>     composer install


### Configuration

Please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/nextcloud/cms_pico/wiki) for more details.
