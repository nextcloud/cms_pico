## Description

The app **Pico CMS** integrate [Pico CMS](https://picocms.org/) in your Nextcloud.

This will allow your users to create and manage their own websites with address like *https://<spam></spam>cloud.example.com\/sites\/my_site\/* or *http://<spam></spam>mysite.com\/site\/test*.

## Edit using *Markdown*

The source of the website are *Markdown* files (.md), which are stored in users' folders defined by each user.

This files can contain [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/), regular HTML and [YAML headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) and will be automatically formatted by *Pico CMS* to generate the HTML pages.

Because *Pico CMS* is using the *Markdown* format, you should consider enabling the [Markdown Editor](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_markdown) app.

## Configuration

Please check the [Wiki](https://github.com/nextcloud/cms_pico/wiki) for more details.
